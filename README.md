# Flappy Bird Game with NEAT

# Overview
This project implements the classic game Flappy Bird using Python and Pygame library. The game includes features such as pixel-perfect collision detection using masks and is integrated with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) for training birds to play the game.

# Features
  Pixel-perfect collision detection
  NEAT algorithm for bird training
  Dynamic generation and evaluation of bird genomes
  Visualizations using Pygame
  Getting Started
  To run the game locally:
